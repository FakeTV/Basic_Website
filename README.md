# Basic_Website
If you're interested in running a small website alongside your FakeTV setup, this is a good place to get started


What will soon be added:
- PreReq steps to take to make this work (PHP, Apache, Permissions, Alaising)
- Common issues and how to solve them

Improvements:
- Can make it so you only have to enter your IP address once (not a bunch of times)
- Make it so permissions and aliasing is not necessary
